These are the websites and videos that helped me to create this project:
[The Official Redux Essentials Docs](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to understand redux in a really deep manner with this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it took me a long time to get through it, it was
