## References

These are the websites and videos that helped me to create this project:

### Redux

- [The Official Redux Essentials Docs](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to understand redux in a really deep manner with this.  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it took me a long time to get through it, it was  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;definitely worth it.
- [Human Redux](https://read.reduxbook.com/)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pretty old online book on redux. But I still found it to
  &nbsp;&nbsp;be useful. I was able to get a good understanding on how Redux
  &nbsp;&nbsp;works. I read through the first two chapters.

#### Redux thunks

Thunks were a topic that I found a bit hard to get around my head. These articles
really helped me get a grasp of how thunks and async flow work in redux

### React

### TypeScript

I decided to learn TypeScript this week since the Redux documentation recommended
using TS with Redux. And I have wanted to understand what TS is for a long time now
so I thought "why not?" :shrug:

- [Scrimba's course on TS](https://scrimba.com/learn-typescript-c03c)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;This was a really good introduction to TypeScript.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The course was pretty entertaining and had a good pace.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Would definitely recommend. :thumbsup:
